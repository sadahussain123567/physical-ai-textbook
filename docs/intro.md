# Introduction & Why Physical AI Matters

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook! This comprehensive, production-grade, interactive textbook fully teaches the entire Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics curriculum.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with the physical world through robotics. Unlike traditional AI that operates primarily in digital spaces, Physical AI must navigate, understand, and interact with the real world's complexity, uncertainty, and physics.

## Course Overview

This textbook is structured across four modules that mirror the official quarter structure:

- **Module 1**: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Learn the foundation of robotic software architecture
- **Module 2**: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity) - Explore simulation environments for robotics
- **Module 3**: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac) - Understand intelligent control and perception
- **Module 4**: Vision-Language-Action & Capstone - Integrate all concepts in advanced applications

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this textbook, you will:

- Understand the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Master ROS 2 architecture, nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Build and simulate robots using Gazebo and modern simulation tools
- Implement perception and control systems with NVIDIA Isaac
- Develop Vision-Language-Action models for robotics
- Complete a comprehensive capstone project integrating all concepts

Let's begin this journey into the future of robotics and artificial intelligence!
